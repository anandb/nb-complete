# Quickstart Guide

[![Support this project](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenCode-Referral-FF6C37?style=flat&logo=openai&logoColor=white)](https://opencode.ai/go?ref=DWTNHGN9KX)

This document covers features available in the latest release. The plugin can be downloaded from
**Maven Central** or built from source. Due to the release cadence, there may be a delay before
new versions appear on the NetBeans plugin portal.

## Setup

1. **Prerequisites** — Install [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/), then connect and configure your
   providers. This plugin acts as a client to an OpenCode process running as an agent server.
   On Wayland, install the `wl-clipboard` package for image paste support.
2. **Installation** — Download the `.nbm` file from
   [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.anandb/beanbot/versions). In
   NetBeans, navigate to `Tools > Plugins > Downloaded` and add the file.
3. **Access** — Open the interface via `Window > Assistant` or the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + L`.
4. **Configuration** — The plugin auto-detects the OpenCode binary on your system `PATH`. To
   override, set the path manually under `Options > Assistant`.
5. **Preamble** — Define a global system prompt in `Options > Assistant > Preamble`. This is
   prepended to every new session alongside your OpenCode agent prompts.
